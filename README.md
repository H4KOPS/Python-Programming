# Assignments — Basic Python Exercises ✅

**Short description**

This README documents the two assignment scripts in the `Assignments/` folder.

---

## Files & Functionality 🔧

- `Assignments/Assignment_1_a.py` — Prompts for two integers and prints the results of several arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Exponentiation
  - Floor division

- `Assignments/Assignment_1_b.py` — Prompts for first and last name and prints a personalized welcome message using an f-string.

---

## How to run ▶️

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Change directory to the project root, for example:

   ```bash
   cd "c:\\Users\\Admin\\OneDrive\\Documents\\TuteDude\\Python Programming\\Assignments"
   ```

3. Run either script with Python:

   ```bash
   python Assignment_1_a.py
   python Assignment_1_b.py
   ```

(On Windows you can also use `py` if needed.)

## Notes & Tips ⚠️

- Recommended: Python 3.7 or newer.
- These scripts are educational and do minimal input validation. Non-numeric input or division by zero will raise errors.
- Tip: wrap input parsing in `try/except` blocks and validate values before performing operations for a more robust script.

If you'd like, I can add usage examples, input validation, or a small test script for these assignments. ✨
